# Structured Outputs with llama-cpp-python

Open-source LLMS are gaining popularity, and llama-cpp-python has made the `llama-cpp` model available to obtain structured outputs using JSON schema via a mixture of [constrained sampling](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#json-schema-mode) and [speculative decoding](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#speculative-decoding). They also support a [OpenAI compatible client](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#openai-compatible-web-server), which can be used to obtain structured output as a in process mechanism to avoid any network dependency.

## Patching

Instructor's patch enhances an create call it with the following features:

- `response_model` in `create` calls that returns a pydantic model
- `max_retries` in `create` calls that retries the call if it fails by using a backoff strategy

!!! note "Learn More"

    To learn more, please refer to the [docs](../../index.md). To understand the benefits of using Pydantic with Instructor, visit the tips and tricks section of the [why use Pydantic](../../why.md) page. If you want to check out examples of using Pydantic with Instructor, visit the [examples](../../examples/index.md) page.

## llama-cpp-python

Recently llama-cpp-python added support for structured outputs via JSON schema mode. This is a time-saving alternative to extensive prompt engineering and can be used to obtain structured outputs.

In this example we'll cover a more advanced use case of JSON_SCHEMA mode to stream out partial models. To learn more [partial streaming](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/concepts/partial.md) check out partial streaming.

import llama_cpp
from llama_cpp.llama_speculative import LlamaPromptLookupDecoding

In our recent online meeting, participants from various backgrounds joined to discuss
the upcoming tech conference. The names and contact details of the participants were as follows:

- Name: John Doe, Email: johndoe@email.com, Twitter: @TechGuru44
- Name: Jane Smith, Email: janesmith@email.com, Twitter: @DigitalDiva88
- Name: Alex Johnson, Email: alexj@email.com, Twitter: @CodeMaster2023

During the meeting, we agreed on several key points. The conference will be held on March 15th, 2024,
at the Grand Tech Arena located at 4521 Innovation Drive. Dr. Emily Johnson, a renowned AI researcher,
will be our keynote speaker.

The budget for the event is set at $50,000, covering venue costs, speaker fees, and promotional activities.
Each participant is expected to contribute an article to the conference blog by February 20th.

A follow-up meetingis scheduled for January 25th at 3 PM GMT to finalize the agenda and confirm the list of speakers.

We use LlamaPromptLookupDecoding to speed up structured output generation using speculative decoding. The draft model generates candidate tokens during generation 10 is good for GPU, 2 is good for CPU.
2. We use `instructor.Mode.JSON_SCHEMA` return a JSON schema response.
3. We use `instructor.Partial` to stream out partial models.
4. This is just a simple example of how to stream out partial models and clear the console.
